Mah Jongg Leaderboard for NoLibs Mah Jongg group

⚠️ One thing to know about localStorage on GitHub Pages
The data saves per browser, per device — so if one club member logs a game on their laptop, it won't automatically sync to another member's computer. Since all 12 of you share one leaderboard, I'd recommend designating one person as the "scorekeeper" who logs all results from a single device/browser. That way the data stays consistent.
If you ever want true multi-user sync across devices, that would require a small backend (like Firebase), which I can set up for you — but for a casual club, the single-device approach works great.
